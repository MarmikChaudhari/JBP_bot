# Jordan Peterson Bot

Here's a link to the Twitter bot: https://twitter.com/real_JBP (tracery), https://twitter.com/RealBot_JBP (markovify+spacy)

As a serious intellectual (I am a high school student), I believe that Jordan B Peterson has an inherently flawed view of the world (he's just dumb). So I spent a lot of time on this bot (an hour or two), in order to highlight his flawed logic (and slander him).

For any additions to the tracery pseuadocode, submit a pull request, and I'll add it to the Github repo.
