Here's a link to the Twitter bot: https://twitter.com/real_JBP (tracery), https://twitter.com/RealBot_JBP (markovify+spacy)

As a serious intellectuals (we are high school students), we believe that Jordan B Peterson has an inherently flawed view of the world (he's just dumb). So we spent a lot of time on this bot , in order to highlight his flawed logic (and slander him).
