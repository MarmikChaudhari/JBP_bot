# Jordan Peterson Bot

Here's a link to the Twitter bot: https://twitter.com/real_JBP (tracery), https://twitter.com/RealBot_JBP (markovify+spacy)

As a serious intellectual (we are high school students), we believe that Jordan B Peterson has an inherently flawed view of the world (he's just dumb). So we spent a lot of time on this bot , in order to highlight his flawed logic (and shit on him).

For any additions to the 'code', submit a pull request, and I'll add it to both the Github repo.
