# Jordan Peterson Bot

Here's a link to the Twitter bot: https://twitter.com/realJBP_

As a serious intellectual (I am a high school student), I believe that Jordan B Peterson has an inherently flawed view of the world (he's just dumb). So I spent a lot of time on this bot (took me like an hour), in order to highlight his flawed logic (and shit on him).

For any additions to the 'code', submit a pull request, and I'll add it to both the Github repo, and https://cheapbotsdonequick.com
