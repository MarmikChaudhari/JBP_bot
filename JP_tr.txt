"people need to search for meaning because they get corrupted by suffering if their life isn’t meaningful" ,

"We seem to have come to a pretty general consensus, I would say, that claims of ethnic or racial superiority place you outside the realm of acceptable political discourse" ,

"I think the classic errors of the right are to fail to attend sufficiently to the tendency for hierarchies to degenerate into corruption, because of wilful blindness and rigidity—and, of course, that’s something that the left takes the right to task for, generally speaking"

"I think the right errs in the same way that the left does, when they play identity politics" ,

"Insofar as the left-wingers and the right-winger are collectivist, then they’re wrong" ,

"Left-leaning people don’t like boundaries between things, which is also why I think the left-leaning people can’t draw boundaries within their own domain" ,

"If you don’t treat yourself like an active agent imbued with the logos, then your life doesn’t go well " ,

" I’m horrified by what the radical left is capable of, but that doesn’t make me angry" ,

"The thing about the post-modernist types is they’re nested inside Marxism " ,

" I’m not saying made up words generated by post-modern neomarxists because I despise everything they stand for, and so I’m not using those damn words" .

"It was interesting listening to Trump’s inauguration speech because I detected elements of national socialist thought in it" ,
